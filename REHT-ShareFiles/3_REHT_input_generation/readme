#1. prepare multiple mdp files by running temp.sh

#2. scaling topologies:
#first produce the processed.top file using 'grompp -pp' to contain all the parameters. The processed.top file should not have any "#include" statement.
# choose the "hot" atoms
vi processed.top # specify the hot atoms by appending "_" to each atom type under [ atoms ] section of protein molecule in the topology file
# generate the actual topology using plumed partial_tempering. This can be done through the scale_topol.sh.
# In case if you use charmm36 forcefield, remember to scale the cmap term. This can be done through lines 30-43 in scale_topol.sh
